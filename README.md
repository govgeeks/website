This is the git repo for the govgeeks.org website.

Please help us make this quick hack better.

## Notes

# Local dev

For local development we use Mongoose but YMMV, other web server solutions are out there.

mongoose -document_root ./ -enable_directory_listing yes -index_files index.shtml -ssi_pattern **.shtml$
